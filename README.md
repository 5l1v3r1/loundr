## Usage

### Downloading Homebrew
To start with I would really recommend downloading 
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you do not have it already; it will make it easier to go through the installation process.

### Downloading Node and npm
You will definitely need to install Node which also goes with npm (node package manager). Make sure to install the **Current Version** with the **Latest Features** over here - 
[Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).


### Downloading Expo
Next, download **expo-cli**:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```
Verify if the installation was successful by
```bash
expo whoami
```
You should get:
> "Not logged in"

If you are using Mac, you should also [install Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#buildinstall) - you can use Homebrew for that.

Visit the official [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/) for get info on how to set up simulators
(Note: you cannot use an iOS simulator if you are not using a Mac; nevertheless, I have heard there are ways one could do it)

### Running the program
If you fork the repo and then pull it you can go into the project folder and
```bash
expo start
```
or
```bash
npm start
```
to start your app. You will also see the terminal, giving your further instructions on how to run the app on the emulators.
